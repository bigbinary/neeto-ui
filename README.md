**NeetoUI** is a component library from [BigBinary](https://www.bigbinary.com).
Checkout the [online demo and documentation](https://neeto-ui.netlify.app).

## Installation

```
yarn add https://github.com/bigbinary/neeto-ui.git
```

NeetoUI relies on [Remixicons](https://remixicon.com/) for it's icons.
Install it by executing following command.

```
yarn add remixicon
```

Import the styles in your `application.scss` file by doing

```
import 'remixicon/fonts/remixicon.css'
```

## Development

Install all the dependencies by executing following command.

```
yarn
```

You can create new components in the `lib/components` and export them from `lib/index.js`.

Running the `yarn start` command starts a CRA app which resides in `src` folder. Use this application to test out changes. Note that nothing in the `src` folder will be bundled with NeetoUI.

## Building

Run `yarn build` to build new bundle files and **increment the version number** in `package.json`.
Make sure to commit and push the changes to Github. In the host application, run `yarn add https://github.com/bigbinary/neeto-ui.git` to update it to the latest version.
