Often times, we will have to handle server validation errors in the forms.
It's not ideal to show toasts in such cases; the user would not get any clue about which
field caused the error or what action they should take.

The recommended way to handle this is to set the errors in the Formik state.
Thus, the user could see the error near the field and act on it. The problem with using the errors
state of Formik is that it gets mixed with the frontend validation schema, leading to unexpected
results.

To solve this, we have added a feature to the neetoUI Form and Formik components. We will use `status`
in the Formik state to handle this. When there's a server-side validation error, you can set it in `status` as
a key-value pair with the `key` as the field name and the `value` as the error using the `setStatus`
helper from the Formik actions.

The Formik components will show the set status as an inline error. It will reset the status when the user
types in something in the field and additionally prevents submission if there are statuses set for some of the fields.
