`import { Form } from "@bigbinary/neetoui/formik";`

The neetoUI `Form` component serves as an abstraction layer for the `Formik` and
`Form` components in the `formik` library.

It has a built-in mechanism to scroll to the element that gave an error when the
form is submitted. This is handled by the `ScrollToErrorField` component within
it. It can be turned on by passing the prop `scrollToErrorField`.

Please note that the `name` prop of input components must be in dot notation.
For example: `name="firstName"` or `name="addJob.name"` are both valid. While
`name="addJob[name]"` is valid for the form to work, such a name cannot be
parsed by the `ScrollToErrorField` component.

In the below story, scroll down to see the submit button and click on it. This
will trigger the validations and scroll to the field which gave the error.
