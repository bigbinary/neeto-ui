`import { BlockNavigation } from "@bigbinary/neetoui/formik";`

The neetoUI `BlockNavigation` component is used to prevent navigation when there
are unsaved changes. It is designed to enhance the user experience by alerting
users to the presence of pending modifications and giving them the option to
save or discard those changes before navigating away from the current page or
route.
