`import { Toastr } from "@bigbinary/neetoui";`

`Toastr` is a user interface component that displays transient messages near the
edge of the screen and then fades away after a short duration, providing a
non-intrusive way to communicate updates, alerts, or information to the user.

We use React-Toastify under the hood. For extra customization, refer
[React-Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify) documentation.
