# CSS variables

neetoUI incorporates many CSS custom properties (variables) in its compiled CSS for real-time customization without the need to recompile Sass. These offer easy access to commonly used values like our theme colors, font sizes, box shadows etc.

All our custom properties are prefixed with `neeto-ui` to avoid conflicts with third party CSS.

<br />

### Root variables

Here are the variables we include that are accessible from any location where neetoUI's CSS is loaded. They’re located in our \_root.scss file and included in our compiled CSS file.

```css
:root {

}
```

### Examples

CSS variables offer similar flexibility to Sass’s variables, but without the need for compilation before being served to the browser.

```
a {
  color: rgb(var(--neeto-ui-primary-700));
}
```
