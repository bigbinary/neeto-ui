### Usage of Table within a Layout

The below story is a simple example of a table within a layout. Make sure the Table component is a child of the `Container` component.
`Container` has the `overflow-y` value set as `auto` which will allow the table to scroll within the container.

```jsx
<Container>
  <Header />
  <Subheader />
  <Table />
</Container>
```
