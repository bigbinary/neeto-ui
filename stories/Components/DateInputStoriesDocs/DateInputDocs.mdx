`import { DatePicker } from "@bigbinary/neetoui";`

`DatePicker` allows users to select a specific date from a calendar or input it
manually.

We use Ant Design's `DatePicker` component under the hood. For extra
customization, refer
[AntD DatePicker](https://ant.design/components/date-picker/#API).
