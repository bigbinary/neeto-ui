`import { DateTimePicker } from "@bigbinary/neetoui";`

`DateTimePicker` allows users to select a specific date and time from a calendar
or input it manually.

We use Ant Design's `DatePicker` component and 'TimeInput' component from
react-time-picker under the hood. For extra customization, refer
[AntD DatePicker](https://ant.design/components/date-picker/#API).
[react-time-picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-time-picker#user-guide).
