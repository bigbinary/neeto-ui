Starting from v6, neeto-ui supports enhanced customization of components using
CSS variables. These are the variables that are being used in the
`ActionDropdown` component.

```css
--neeto-ui-action-dropdown-gap: 1px;
--neeto-ui-action-dropdown-border-radius: 0px;
```

You can use these variables to customize the component to your liking. Here is
an example:

```css
.neetix-actiondropdown {
  --neeto-ui-action-dropdown-border-radius: 1px;
}
```

#### Output
