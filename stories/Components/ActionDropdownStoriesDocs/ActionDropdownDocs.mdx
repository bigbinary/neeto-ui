`import { ActionDropdown } from "@bigbinary/neetoui";`

`ActionDropdown` combines a dropdown menu with a button, allowing users to
select an option from the dropdown and perform the corresponding action using
the button.

The `ActionDropdown` component has three subcomponents:

- `ActionDropdown.Menu`: Defines the container for organizing and displaying a
  list of clickable items.
- `ActionDropdown.MenuItem`: Represents an individual item or option in the
  dropdown menu. `ActionDropdown.MenuItem.Button` provides a button-like element
  within a menu item.
- `ActionDropdown.Divider`: Creates a visual separation or divider between
  groups of menu items.

You can use destructuring assignment to conveniently access subcomponents of the
`ActionDropdown` component as follows:

```
const { Menu, MenuItem, Divider } = ActionDropdown;
```

This simplifies the code and allows you to work with these subcomponents
directly.
