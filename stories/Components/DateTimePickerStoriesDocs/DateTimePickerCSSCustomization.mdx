Starting from v6, neeto-ui supports enhanced customization of components using
CSS variables. These are the variables that are being used in the
`DateTimePicker` component.

```css
--neeto-ui-date-time-picker-gap: -1px;
--neeto-ui-date-time-picker-border-radius: 0px;
```

You can use these variables to customize the component to your liking. Here is
an example:

```css
.neetix-datetimepicker {
  --neeto-ui-date-time-picker-gap: 2px;
  --neeto-ui-date-time-picker-border-radius: 4px;
}
```
