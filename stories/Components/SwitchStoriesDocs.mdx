`import { Switch } from "@bigbinary/neetoui";`

`Switch` allows users to alternate between two states, typically on and off,
with a single action.

`Switch` differs from `Checkbox` in that it immediately alters the state upon
toggling, whereas `Checkbox` is typically employed for state marking, often
requiring interaction with a submit operation.
