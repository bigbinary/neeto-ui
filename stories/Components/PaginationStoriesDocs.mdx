`import { Pagination } from "@bigbinary/neetoui";`

`Pagination` allows users to navigate through a large set of content by dividing
it into smaller, manageable pages.

We use Ant Design's `Pagination` component under the hood. For extra
customization, refer
[AntD Pagination](https://ant.design/components/pagination/#API).
