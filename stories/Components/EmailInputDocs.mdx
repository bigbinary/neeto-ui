If you want to use `counter` prop on `EmailInput` component, then, please follow the below syntax.

For the basic implementation, see the following example:

```jsx
<EmailInput counter />
```

For specifying the counter label for i18n purposes, see the following example:

```jsx
<EmailInput counter={{ label: "E-mail" }} />
```

For specifying the counter to start counting after a specific number of emails, then see the following example:

```jsx
<EmailInput counter={{ startsFrom: 3 }} />
```
