For the basic implementation, see the following example:

```jsx
<EmailInput counter />
```

For specifying the counter label for i18n purposes, see the following example:

```jsx
<EmailInput counter={{ label: "E-mail" }} />
```

To start showing the counter label only from a specific number of emails, then see the following example:

```jsx
<EmailInput counter={{ startsFrom: 3 }} />
```
