`import { Dropdown } from "@bigbinary/neetoui";`

`Dropdown` presents a list of options in a menu that can be expanded when
clicked, allowing users to select one option from the list.

The `Dropdown` component has three subcomponents:

- `Dropdown.Menu`: Defines the container for organizing and displaying a list of
  clickable items.
- `Dropdown.MenuItem`: Represents an individual item or option in the dropdown
  menu. `Dropdown.MenuItem.Button` provides a button-like element within a menu
  item.
- `Dropdown.Divider`: Creates a visual separation or divider between groups of
  menu items.

You can use destructuring assignment to conveniently access subcomponents of the
`Dropdown` component as follows:

```
const { Menu, MenuItem, Divider } = Dropdown;
```

This simplifies the code and allows you to work with these subcomponents
directly.

We use `Tippy` component from Tippy.js under the hood. For extra customization,
