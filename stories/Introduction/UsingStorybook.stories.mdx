# Using Storybook
We use Storybook to test and document the neetoUI components. This guide is for users who are new to Storybook.


## Canvas
The canvas in Storybook is where a single selected story will display.

<img src={Canvas}  />

<br />

## Docs
The docs tab in Storybook displays all stories under a selected component. This view also lists all the available props on the React component with descriptions of each prop.

<br/>

<img src={Docs}  />

## Controls
Storybook controls gives you a graphical UI to interact with a component's arguments dynamically, so you can edit them live.

## Viewport
The viewport toolbar item allows you to adjust the dimensions of the iframe component story is rendered in. It makes it easy to develop responsive UIs.
