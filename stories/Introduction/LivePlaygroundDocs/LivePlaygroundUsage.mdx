We use `react-live` to render the code you write in the editor. They have documented what it can [render](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/react-live/docs/usage).
Please read the documentation for a better understanding of how to use the editor.

All the NeetoUI components, atoms, and hooks are set in the scope. You can directly use them:
`<Button label="hello world" />`

To use Formik components, please use them from the FormikComponents namespace:
`<FormikComponents.Form>
  <FormikComponents.Button label="hello world" />
</FormikComponents.Form>`
